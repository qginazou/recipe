# Cauliflower Fried Rice

### **1. In a small bowl, stir soy sauce, mirin, and sugar; set aside.**

### 2. In a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high heat, heat oil until just shimmering. Add shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer shallots to a paper-towel lined plate. Discard all but 1 tablespoon oil from skillet.


### 3. In same skillet over medium-high heat, cook eggs, stirring occasionally, until scrambled, about 30 seconds. Transfer eggs to a small bowl.
### 4. In same skillet over medium-high heat, cook carrots, garlic, and peas, stirring frequently, until warmed through, about 30 seconds. Add cauliflower and stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are slightly softened, about 2 minutes.
### 5. Increase heat to high. Add reserved soy sauce mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until liquid is mostly evaporated, about 1 minute. Stir in eggs; season with salt and pepper.
